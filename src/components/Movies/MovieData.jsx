In 1926 New York, something mysterious is leaving a path of destruction, threatening to expose the wizarding community to fanatical No-Majs (American for Muggles) bent on eradicating them. And the dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald, after wreaking havoc in Europe, is now nowhere to be found. Magizoologist Newt Scamander arrives in the city nearing the end of a global excursion to research and rescue magical creatures, some of which are safeguarded in his nondescript leather case. Unsuspecting No-Maj Jacob Kowalski inadvertently lets some of Newt’s beasts loose in the city – a serious breach of the Statute of Secrecy that former Auror Tina Goldstein jumps on, seeing a chance to regain her post. However, things take an ominous turn when Percival Graves, the enigmatic Director of Magical Security, casts his suspicions on Newt…and Tina. Now allied, Newt and Tina, together with Tina’s sister Queenie and Jacob, form a band of unlikely heroes who must recover Newt’s missing beasts. The stakes are higher than they ever imagined as their mission puts them on a collision course with dark forces that could push the wizarding and No-Maj worlds to the brink of war.",
